You are one of seven parallel agents building **Mind Palace** at a hackathon, each in its own Superset workspace and git branch. An integrator merges your PR into `main`.

Before anything else:
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` (rules, ownership, commands) and the parts of `docs/SPEC.md` referenced below.
2. Load the `palace-contracts` skill and your workspace skill (named below).
3. Run `bun install && bun run validate && bun run typecheck` to confirm the baseline is green.

Hard rules: edit only the files in your Owns row of CLAUDE.md; never change `server/schema.ts`, `web/src/api.ts` or `web/src/events.ts` (write proposals in `docs/NOTES-<workspace>.md`); commit every 20-30 min naming the checkbox that passed; features freeze at 4:15 PM. Prefer a smaller thing that demos over a bigger thing that doesn't. Don't stop to ask questions — make the reasonable call, note it in your NOTES file, keep going.

When done: run your skill's Verify step, write `.claude/skills/<workspace>-lessons/SKILL.md`, push your branch and open a PR to `main` with `gh pr create` whose description lists the checked-off acceptance criteria and pastes the verification output.
